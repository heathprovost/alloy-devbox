# ðŸª„ Alloy DevBox
Automated script magic for configuring machines or containers
for [alloy](https://github.com/StullerInc/alloy) development.

## Installation

There is no install and there are no dependencies other than your target environment must be running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
or higher. Setup is performed by simply downloading [devbox.sh](devbox.sh) and running it on the target machine, VM, or container.

By default you will be promted to provide a few options, but you can create a file called `.devboxrc` to provide default responses for unattended installs if you prefer. For example:

```env
name = Lorem Ipsum
email = lorem_ipsum@domain.com
token = ghp_YourGithubTokenForNpmPackageInstalls
```
Just place this file in the folder where you downloaded the script before running it.
